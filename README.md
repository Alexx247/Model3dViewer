# üåü Model3dViewer: Interactive 3D Model Viewer for Android

![Model3dViewer](https://img.shields.io/badge/Model3dViewer-v1.0-blue.svg) ![Releases](https://img.shields.io/badge/Releases-latest-orange.svg)

Welcome to the **Model3dViewer** repository! This project serves as a proof of concept for an Android application that demonstrates how to embed interactive 3D models into a Jetpack Compose UI. Using a WebView and Three.js, this app allows for real-time scene configuration, model loading, and orientation control through device sensors.

### üîç Features

- **Interactive 3D Models**: Load and interact with STL and glTF models.
- **Jetpack Compose UI**: Modern UI toolkit for Android.
- **WebView Integration**: Seamlessly display 3D models in your app.
- **Real-Time Configuration**: Change scene settings on the fly.
- **Orientation Control**: Use device sensors for intuitive navigation.

### üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

This project utilizes a range of technologies to create a robust and efficient application:

- **Kotlin**: The primary programming language for Android development.
- **Jetpack Compose**: A modern toolkit for building native UI.
- **Three.js**: A powerful JavaScript library for 3D graphics.
- **WebView**: For rendering web content within the app.
- **STL & glTF**: Formats for 3D model files.

### üì• Installation

To get started with **Model3dViewer**, you can download the latest release from the [Releases section](https://github.com/Alexx247/Model3dViewer/releases). Simply download the APK file and install it on your Android device.

### üìñ Usage

Once installed, open the app. You will see a simple interface that allows you to load different 3D models. Here‚Äôs how to use the app:

1. **Load a Model**: Tap the "Load Model" button to select an STL or glTF file.
2. **Interact**: Use touch gestures to rotate, zoom, and pan the model.
3. **Adjust Settings**: Modify scene settings in real-time.
4. **Use Sensors**: Tilt your device to change the orientation of the model.
